# DATABASE ASSIGNMENT
## A bookstore database
## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates the design and implementation of a real-world **BookStore Management System** using **MySQL**. It covers every critical aspect of database development, including schema design, normalization, data entry, access control, and data querying.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL** – Database Engine
- **Draw.io** – ERD Design
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** – Data Manipulation

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design an efficient relational schema for a bookstore.
- Create and populate multiple normalized tables.
- Manage database access securely.
- Run meaningful SQL queries to extract insights.
- Apply security best practices in MySQL.

---

## 🏗️ Database Schema (ERD)
The project consists of 15 interconnected tables including:

- `book`, `author`, `book_author`
- `publisher`, `book_language`
- `customer`, `address`, `country`, `customer_address`, `address_status`
- `cust_order`, `order_line`, `order_status`, `order_history`, `shipping_method`
